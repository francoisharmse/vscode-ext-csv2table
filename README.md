# TODO
1. Export Filtered/Sorted Data
Allow users to export the currently viewed table (after sorting/filtering) back to a CSV or JSON.

ðŸ›  Button: "Export View as CSV"

2. Column Visibility Toggle
Let users hide/show columns dynamically via checkboxes or a dropdown.

Good for focusing on specific fields.

3. Inline Cell Editing
Allow editing cell values directly in the table.

Option to save changes back to the original CSV or export as new.

4. Search Across All Columns
Global search box that filters rows based on a term across all columns.

5. Data Type Detection
Infer and show the type (number, date, string) for each column.

Could enable smart sorting (e.g., dates sorted chronologically).

6. Highlighting / Conditional Formatting
Let users apply simple rules, e.g., highlight values above/below a threshold.

7. Column Reordering via Drag & Drop
Improve UX by letting users rearrange columns visually.

8. Summary Row / Stats
Add an optional footer row to show stats per column:

Count, Sum (for numeric), Min, Max, Avg

Right-click â†’ Copy value / Copy row as CSV

Let users mark rows for quick reference.
